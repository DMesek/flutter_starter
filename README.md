# Flutter Starter

Flutter skeleton project that should be a starting point for every new project. It should have all environments already setup (dev, staging, production) for iOS and Android. Project will be CI/CD friendly. Q packages should be automatically added. Mandatory checks will be added to enforce inclusion of crashlytics, analytics, coding standards and test code coverage. Project won't build if any of this prerequisite are not met.
